[Link](https://rpubs.com/haleyepperlyfox/919270) to published quarto document.

This document details how to create both static and animated maps using the `usmap` and `gganimate` packages. The data used in this map are agricultural subsidies received by US counties from 2010 - 2019, which are publicly available and were scraped from this [website](https://farm.ewg.org/).
